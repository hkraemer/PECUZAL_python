    '''Performs an embedding of time series using the PECUZAL method

    Parameters
    ----------
    s : 'numpy.ndarray' (N, M)
        Input time series of length N as numpy array. This can be a multivariate set, where the M timeseries are stored in the columns.
    taus : `iterable`, optional
        Possible delay values in sampling time units (Default is `taus=range(50)`). For each of the `tau`'s in `taus` the continuity statistic 
        `avrg_eps_star` gets computed and further processed in order to find optimal delays for each embedding cycle.
    theiler : `int`, optional
        Theiler window for excluding serial correlated points from neighbourhood. In sampling time units, Default is `theiler = 1`.
    sample_size : `float`, optional
        Number of considered fiducial points as a fraction of input time series length, i.e. a float from interval (0,1.] (Default is 
        `sample_size = 1.0`, i.e., all points of the acutal trajectory get considered).
    K : `int`, optional
        The amount of nearest neighbors in the Delta-ball. Must be at least 8 (in order to guarantee a valid statistic) and the Default is
        `K = 13`. The continuity statistic `avrg_eps_star` is computed in each embedding cycle, taking the minimum result over all `k in K`.
    KNN : `int`, optional
        The number of nearest neighbors to be considered in the L-statistic, Default is `KNN = 3`.  
    Tw_factor : `int`, optional
        The maximal considered time horizon for obtaining the L-statistic as a factor getting multiplied with the given `theiler`:
        `Tw = Tw_factor * theiler` and Default is `Tw_factor = 4`. If `theiler` is set to, say, `theiler = 15` and `Tw_factor` is on its Default
        the maximal considered time horizon `Tw` for obtaining the L-statistic is `Tw = Tw_factor * 15 = 4 * 15 = 60`.
    alpha : `float`, optional
        Significance level for obtaining the continuity statistic `avrg_eps_star` in each embedding cycle (Default is `alpha = 0.05`).
    p : `float`, optional
        Binominal p for obtaining the continuity statistic `avrg_eps_star` in each embedding cycle (Default is `p = 0.5`).
    max_cycles : `int`, optional
        The algorithm will stop after that many cycles no matter what. Default is `max_cycles = 10`.
    
    Returns
    -------
    Y : 'numpy.ndarray' (N', m)
        The trajectory from the embedding of length `N' = N-sum(tau_vals)` of dimension `m` (embedding dimension)
    tau_vals : 'list' [`int`]
        The chosen delay values for each embedding cycle, `len(tau_vals) = m`.
    ts_vals : 'list' [`int`]
        The according time series number (index) chosen for each delay value in `tau_vals`, `len(ts_vals) = m`. For univariate embedding
        `ts_vals` is a vector of zeros of length `tau_vals`, because there is simply just one time series to choose from, i.e. index 0. 
    Ls : 'list'
        The L-statistic for each embedding cycle. The minimum of these values corresponds to the L-value for the returned
        trajectory `Y`.
    avrg_eps_stars : 'list' [`list`]
        The continuity statistics for each embedding cycle. Contains `avrg_eps_star` of each embedding cycle.

    Notes
    -----
    The method works iteratively and gradually builds the final embedding vectors
    `Y`, as proposed in [kraemer2020]_ . Based on the continuity statistic `avrg_eps_star` [pecora2007]_ the algorithm picks an
    optimal delay value `tau_i` for each embedding cycle `i`. For achieving that, we take the inpute time series 
    `s` and compute the continuity statistic `avrg_eps_star`. 1. Each local maxima in `avrg_eps_star` is used 
    for constructing a candidate embedding trajectory `Y_trial` with a delay corresponding to that
    specific peak in `avrg_eps_star`. 2. We then compute the `L`-statistic [uzal2011]_ for `Y_trial`. 3. We pick the 
    peak/`tau`-value, for which `L` is minimal and construct the actual embedding trajectory `Y_actual` (steps 
    1.-3. correspond to an embedding cycle). 4. We repeat steps 1.-3. with `Y_actual` as input and stop the
    algorithm when `L` can not be reduced anymore. `Y_actual` -> `Y`.

    In case of multivariate embedding, i.e. when embedding a set of `M` time series, in each embedding cycle 
    `avrg_eps_star` gets computed for all `M` time series available. The optimal delay value `tau_i` in each 
    embedding cycle `i` is chosen as the peak/`tau`-value for which `L` is minimal under all available peaks 
    and under all M `avrg_eps_star`'s. In the first embedding cycle there will be M**2 different `avrg_eps_star`'s
    to consider, since it is not clear a priori which time series of the input should consitute the first component 
    of the embedding vector and form `Y_actual`.

    For distance computations the Euclidean norm is used.

    L : `float`

        i.e. considering all points of the trajectory. The length of `L_local` is `N' = len(Y)-Tw`.

    Notes
    -----
    The `L`-statistic is based on theoretical arguments on noise amplification, the complexity of the reconstructed attractor and a 
    direct measure of local stretch, which constitutes an irrelevance measure [uzal2011]_. Technically, it is the logarithm of the product of the
    :math:`\\sigma`-statistic and a normalization statistic :math:`\\alpha` :

    .. math:: 
        L = log_{10}(\\sigma\\alpha)

    The :math:`\\sigma`-statistic is computed as follows. :math:`\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2} = \\sqrt{E^2/\\varepsilon^2}`.
    :math:`E^2` approximates the conditional variance at each point in state space and for a time horizon :math:`T \\in Tw`, using :math:`K` 
    nearest neighbors. For each reference point of the state space trajectory `Y`, the neighborhood consists of the reference point 
    itself and its `K+1` nearest neighbors. :math:`E^2` measures how strong a neighborhood expands during `T` time steps. 
    :math:`E^2` is averaged over many time horizons :math:`T = 1:Tw`. Consequently, :math:`\\varepsilon^2` is the size of the neighborhood at 
    the reference point itself and is defined as the mean pairwise distance of the neighborhood. Finally, :math:`\\sigma^2` gets averaged over 
    a range of reference points on the attractor, which is controlled by `sample_size`. This is just for performance reasons and the most 
    accurate result will obviously be gained when setting `sample_size=1.0`.

    The :math:`\\alpha`-statistic is a normalization factor, such that :math:`\\sigma`'s from different embeddings can be compared. :math:`\\alpha^2`
    is defined as the inverse of the sum of the inverse of all :math:`\\varepsilon^2`'s for all considered reference points.
