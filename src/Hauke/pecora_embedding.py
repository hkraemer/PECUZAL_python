#     # floating number from the interval (0,1] and determines the number of considered
#     # trajectory points (fiducial points) as a fraction from all points. Lets say 
#     # the input time series `var`is of length 10,000 and `datasample=0.5`, then 
#     # 5,000 fiducial points get randomly chosen and the corresponding continuity-
#     # statistic gets computed. `alpha` is the significance level for the continuity-
#     # statistic, `p` is the probability for the binomial distribution. `k` is the 
#     # number of considered nearest neighbors in Uzal's L-statistic and `Tw` is 
#     # the maximum time horizon for the L-statistic. `norm` is the metric for 
#     # distance computations in phase space. This can be restricted to `euclidean`

#     # values for each embedding cycle. Thus, the length of `tau_vals` corresponds
#     # to the dimensionality of `Y`. `ts_vals` is a list storing the chosen time 
#     # series for each delay value in `tau_vals`. In case of univariate embedding,
#     # i.e. when there is just a single time series as input `var`, then `ts_vals`
#     # is a list of same length as `tau_vals` just containing Ones (or Zeros, 
#     # depending on the indexing style you prefer), since there is just one time 
#     # series to choose from. `epsilon_mins` is a list containing the continuity-
#     # statistic for each embedding cycle. `FNNs` contains the amount of false
#     # nearest neighbors for each embedding cycle. `Ls` contains Uzal's L-statistic
#     # for each embedding cycle.
