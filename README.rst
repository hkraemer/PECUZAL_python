PECUZAL Python
==============

We introduce the PECUZAL automatic embedding of time series method for Python. It is solely based
on the paper [kraemer2020]_ `(Open Source) <https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07040>`_, where the functionality is explained in detail. Here we
give an introduction to its easy usage in three examples. Enjoy Embedding! 


Getting started
===============

Install from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_ by simply typing

::

   pip install pecuzal-embedding

in your console.

NOTE
====

This implementation is not profiled well. We recommend to use the implementation
in the `Julia language <https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/dev/>`_ or 
in `Matlab <https://github.com/hkraemer/PECUZAL_Matlab>`_,
in order to get fast results, especially in the multivariate case. Moreover,
it is well documented and embedded in the 
`DynamicalSystems.jl <https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystems.jl/dev/>`_ ecosystem.
For instance, the compuations made in the `sec_univariate <https://hkraemer.github.io/PECUZAL_python/univariate_example.html>`_ 
and the `sec_multivariate <https://hkraemer.github.io/PECUZAL_python/multivariate_example.html>`_
in this documentation took approximately `500s` and `1680s`, respectively. In the Julia implementation
the exact same computation took `3s` and `20s`, respectively! (running on a 2.8GHz Quad-Core i7,  16GB 1600 MHz DDR3)


Documentation
=============

There is a `documentation available <https://hkraemer.github.io/PECUZAL_python/>`_ including some basic usage examples.
